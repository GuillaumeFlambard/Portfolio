        about_me: These lasts years allowed me to achieve strong capacities and knowledge in web development. I also improved my skills in leadership at EdreamsFactory. After two very good years in my first start-up experience at EdreamsFactory and 3 years in Sup'Internet, I'm now in Toronto, Canada to bring my knowledge and to learn new technologies and work methodologies.
        oui_eat_french_description: OuiEatFrench is a marketplace that directly links consumers to farmers. Farmers have their own administration space on the website to select all their products and provide their specific informations. There is also a traceability concept (when the products are harvest, what treatment do they undergo...).<br> And for consumers, they can select a farmer close to their location and choose their fresh products. Consumers can also directly go to the farmer to pick up their order.
        oui_eat_french_specificity: A team of 9 people: 3 developers, 3 designers and 3 commercials. I was in charge of the development team. This project is completely operational, from the administration part to the payment part.
        skills: These are the different skills that I have learned at Sup'Internet and through my internship experiences and of course through my professional experience.

        experience_professionel_edreams_1: I chose EdreamsFactory for my internship at Sup'Internet in second year because they were looking for a developer in symfony2 and I was interested by this technology. My first mission was to continue the EdreamsFactory CRM and I also worked on several projects, especially on a private drivers project.
        experience_professionel_edreams_2: For my last internship, EdreamsFactory offered me to come back with an additional little mission in Android development (mobile development). I really liked to learn and discover new technologies. I learned a lot in this internship especially in the symfony2 framework.
        experience_professionel_edreams_3: EdreamsFacory was the logical choice for my school internships; As a lead developer my team had a good configuration to process all EdreamsFactory's company management projects and softwares efficiently. I even developed the Health project mentionned above in totality, it was my favorite project.
        experience_professionel_opensada: For my first year's internship at Sup'Internet I joined the OpenSada company. I developed many prestashop modules in PHP5 like a size guide, products suggestion, buy packs of products, a cart reminder, an automatic emailing etc. This internship was interested, it consolidated my knowledge in OOP (object-oriented programming).
        project_medical: The Health project is for an Osteopathy school. It is one of the many projects I completed at EdreamsFactory. I particularly liked this project because it was the first project for which I was lead developer and I had very good feedbacks on it. This project is used everyday by more than 500 students, 30 teachers and 2 secretaries. We had to develop a students, teachers and promotions management system. The part I liked the most on this project was the implementation of the schedule generation algorithm for the secretariat to manage their appointements with the available students. I was in charge of the database migration from the old software to the new one.
        project_medical_more: This project is currently online, there is more than 100 consultations per day. I was in charge of the maintenance of this project and I developed every updates.
        project_project_manager: CleverManagement is one of my second year projects at Sup'Internet. The team included 3 developers. We developed a project manager (like Jira) with a homemade framework. This software has a user management system and users can manage their tasks. There is also a time estimation and a balance sheet to know if this project was profitable to the company.
        project_social_club: The Social mustach club is just my favorite project. It was my first year-end school project with a developers team. We had to develop a social network (facebook like) with a personal wall and a public one, we also had an instant message system. We created our own ORM for this project. I am proud of the Social mustach club because it was a pleasure to work on it day and night. The result was really worth it.
        task_manager_description: This project is a basic task manager. You can authenticate yourself, create and remove your own tasks. There is also a filter system. I made this little project to learn new technologies.
